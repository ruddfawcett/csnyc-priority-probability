          <p>Using design-based research and action planning strategies, Alex J. Bowers, Associate Professor of Education Leadership at Teachers College, Columbia University, worked to build collaborative teams through having participants surface their research and action ideas around CS instruction in NYC, then build collaborative ideas together through a series of interactive events in which participants moved through rounds of integration, ideation, prioritization and planning. Through using these types of collaborative design-based action strategies, the group as a whole was able to surface important areas of research, improvement, curiosity, planning and implementation, and then work together to prioritize these issues based on the needs of the communities in which they work.</p>
          <p>Below is a visualization of the brainstorming activity from the CSNYC Knowledge Forum. Overall, there were a total of nine groups and seven categories. We used emic codes to generate common category title based on similar patterns within the artifacts generated from sticky note grouping labeling activity. To see the original grouping label, as well as the individual responses within a group, simply click on the sticky note. For convenience, the sticky notes on the priority-possibility coordinate plane can be rearranged by group or by category.</p>

          <h1>Replication</h1>
          <p>Led by Professor Alex J. Bowers at the CSNYC Knowledge Forum on April 14, 2016, this collaborative and highly interactive activity rolled out in four parts. First, participants listed the ten most important questions they personally wanted to explore within the domain of CS education. Participants worked individually to write down their thoughts on small sticky notes. Second, participants then listed the ten most important topics or questions they felt others should explore within the field of CS education. Again, participants wrote down their individual thoughts on sticky notes. Third, with their individual topics and questions, participants discussed their priorities within their groups and created a mindmap to visually organize their group’s sticky notes into several major themes. Groups were instructed to place their sticky notes on chart paper and label these groups with one to two words. Finally, after grouping their thoughts on chart paper, participants drew a quadrant of coordinate plane, numbering each axis from one to ten. The horizontal axis was labeled “priority,” and the vertical axis was labeled “possibility.” Then, with the newly created mind map of major themes from the group, participants placed their group themes on the coordinate plane based on their perception of the priority and possibility of addressing these priorities for CS education within the next few years. After completing the activity, participants drafted one research question based on how they placed their themes on the priority-possibility plane.</p>
